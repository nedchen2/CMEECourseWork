## **Brief Description**-***Week3 review of the CMEECourseWork***

1. Basic R data structure, function , Vectorization and control flow tools.
2. R debugging
3. Data wrangling and visualization based on tidyverse (super useful)
4. These works are based on the Notebook and Data from https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio.git.

## **Languages**
```
R(99%),Latex,python
```
## **Installation**
```
git clone https://github.com/nedchen2/CMEECourseWork.git
```

## **Dependencies** 

Most of the scripts in the current repository can be ran in baseR. Some of the scripts needs `tidyverse`,`reshape2` package

Installation: `install.packages("*")`

## **Project structure and Usage**

### **(1) Repo Structure introduction**

Each weekâ€™s directory contain directories called `code`, `data`, `results`, and `sandbox` 

### **(2) Scripts List**
> 1.Some simple example scripts would not be included here
> 2.`tidyverse` is extremly useful to do data wrangling and data visualization.Most of the complex wrangling tasks here were done by `tidyverse`.
