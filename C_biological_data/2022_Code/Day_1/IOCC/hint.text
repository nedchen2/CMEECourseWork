### Selected Judges Remarks:

Clever use of the C99 complex data type. The spoiler.zip file contains clues
as to how some winning authors create / edit programs into ASCII shapes.

With the source from the spoiler.zip file could you make the code render for a
larger terminal window?  How about adding more glyphs?

## Author's comments:
No!  Try not.  Do, or do not.  There is no try.

    $ gcc -std=c99 prog.c
    $ a.out
    $ a.out hello.txt
    $ a.out yoda.txt
    $ a.out bear.txt

See spoiler.zip for the source code.
