	abstract = {The use of primary mathematical models with curve fitting software is dramatically changing quantitative food microbiology. The two most widely used primary growth models are the Baranyi and Gompertz models. A three-phase linear model was developed to determine how well growth curves could be described using a simpler model. The model divides bacterial growth curves into three phases: the lag and stationary phases where the specific growth rate is zero (gm=0), and the exponential phase where the logarithm of the bacterial population increases linearly with time (gm=constant). The model has four parameters: No(Log8of initial population density), {NMAX}(Log8of final population density), {tLAG}(time when lag phase ends), and {tMAX}(time when exponential phase ends). A comparison of the linear model was made against the Baranyi and Gompertz models, using established growth data {forEscherichia} coli0157:H7. The growth curves predicted by the three models showed good agreement. The linear model was more ‘robust' than the others, especially when experimental data were minimal. The physiological assumptions underlying the linear model are discussed, with particular emphasis on assuring that the model is consistent with bacterial behavior both as individual cells and as populations. It is proposed that the transitional behavior of bacteria at the end of the lag phase can be explained on the basis of biological variability.},

	abstract = {Microorganisms commonly inhabit energy-limited ecosystems where cellular maintenance and reproduction is highly constrained. To gain insight into how individuals persist under such conditions, we derived demographic parameters from a collection of 21 heterotrophic bacterial taxa by censusing 100 populations in an effectively closed system for 1,000 d. All but one taxon survived prolonged resource scarcity, yielding estimated times to extinction ranging over four orders of magnitude from 100 to 105 y. Our findings corroborate reports of long-lived bacteria recovered from ancient environmental samples, while providing insight into mechanisms of persistence. As death rates declined over time, lifespan was extended through the scavenging of dead cells. Although reproduction was suppressed in the absence of exogenous resources, populations continued to evolve. Hundreds of mutations were acquired, contributing to genome-wide signatures of purifying selection as well as molecular signals of adaptation. Consistent ecological and evolutionary dynamics indicate that distantly related bacteria respond to energy limitation in a similar and predictable manner, which likely contributes to the stability and robustness of microbial life.},

It has been frequently used to describe the growth of animals and plants, as well as the number or volume of bacteria and cancer cells. Numerous parametrisations and re-parametrisations of varying usefulness are found in the literature, whereof the Gompertz-Laird is one of the more commonly used. Here, we review, present, and discuss the many re-parametrisations and some parameterisations of the Gompertz model, which we divide into Ti (type I)- and W0 (type {II})-forms. In the W0-form a starting-point parameter, meaning birth or hatching value (W0), replaces the inflection-time parameter (Ti). We also propose new “unified” versions (U-versions) of both the traditional Ti -form and a simplified W0-form. In these, the growth-rate constant represents the relative growth rate instead of merely an unspecified growth coefficient. We also present U-versions where the growth-rate parameters return absolute growth rate (instead of relative). The new U-Gompertz models are special cases of the Unified-Richards (U-Richards) model and thus belong to the Richards family of U-models. As U-models, they have a set of parameters, which are comparable across models in the family, without conversion equations. The improvements are simple, and may seem trivial, but are of great importance to those who study organismal growth, as the two new U-Gompertz forms give easy and fast access to all shape parameters needed for describing most types of growth following the shape of the Gompertz model.},

	title = {The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for nonlinear least squares curve-ﬁtting problems},
	abstract = {The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was developed in the early 1960’s to solve nonlinear least squares problems. Least squares problems arise in the context of ﬁtting a parameterized mathematical model to a set of data points by minimizing an objective expressed as the sum of the squares of the errors between the model function and a set of data points. If a model is linear in its parameters, the least squares objective is quadratic in the parameters. This objective may be minimized with respect to the parameters in one step via the solution to a linear matrix equation. If the ﬁt function is not linear in its parameters, the least squares problem requires an iterative solution algorithm. Such algorithms reduce the sum of the squares of the errors between the model function and the data points through a sequence of well-chosen updates to values of the model parameters. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm combines two numerical minimization algorithms: the gradient descent method and the Gauss-Newton method. In the gradient descent method, the sum of the squared errors is reduced by updating the parameters in the steepest-descent direction. In the Gauss-Newton method, the sum of the squared errors is reduced by assuming the least squares function is locally quadratic in the parameters, and ﬁnding the minimum of this quadratic. The Levenberg-Marquardt method acts more like a gradient-descent method when the parameters are far from their optimal value, and acts more like the Gauss-Newton method when the parameters are close to their optimal value. This document describes these methods and illustrates the use of software to solve nonlinear least squares curve-ﬁtting problems.},

It is shown that, in regression, when there are many candidate independent variables, standard variable selection procedures can give very misleading results. Also, by selecting a single model, they ignore model uncertainty and so underestimate the uncertainty about quantities of interest. The Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing, model selection, and accounting for model uncertainty is presented. Implementing this is straightforward through the use of the simple and accurate {BIC} approximation, and it can be done using the output from standard software. Specific results are presented for most of the types of model commonly used in sociology. It is shown that this approach overcomes the difficulties with P-values and standard model selection procedures based on them. It also allows easy comparison of nonnested models, and permits the quantification of the evidence for a null hypothesis of interest, such as a convergence theory or a hypothesis about societal norms.},

	abstract = {Regression analysis makes up a large part of supervised machine learning, and consists of the prediction of a continuous independent target from a set of other predictor variables. The difference between binary classification and regression is in the target range: in binary classification, the target can have only two values (usually encoded as 0 and 1), while in regression the target can have multiple values. Even if regression analysis has been employed in a huge number of machine learning studies, no consensus has been reached on a single, unified, standard metric to assess the results of the regression itself. Many studies employ the mean square error ({MSE}) and its rooted variant ({RMSE}), or the mean absolute error ({MAE}) and its percentage variant ({MAPE}). Although useful, these rates share a common drawback: since their values can range between zero and +infinity, a single value of them does not say much about the performance of the regression with respect to the distribution of the ground truth elements. In this study, we focus on two rates that actually generate a high score only if the majority of the elements of a ground truth group has been correctly predicted: the coefficient of determination (also known as R-squared or R2) and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error ({SMAPE}). After showing their mathematical properties, we report a comparison between R2 and {SMAPE} in several use cases and in two real medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the coefficient of determination (R-squared) is more informative and truthful than {SMAPE}, and does not have the interpretability limitations of {MSE}, {RMSE}, {MAE} and {MAPE}. We therefore suggest the usage of R-squared as standard metric to evaluate regression analyses in any scientific domain.},

The psychrotrophic pathogen bacteria are microorganisms of concern for food products with extended shelf life in chilling conditions. The aims of this work were two. Firstly, to evaluate growth behavior of Aeromonas hydrophila {DSM}-30187, Listeria monocytogenes {DSM}-20600, and Yersinia enterocolitica {DSM}-27689 strains, at different temperatures (4, 7, 10, 15, 25, and 30°C) and starting cell concentrations (10 and 106 {CFU}/{mL}), in order to determine the activation energies (Ea) of the relevant lag phases and growth rates. Secondly, to investigate if Mean Kinetic Temperature ({MKT}) might be applied in recording temperature devices to alert a thermal abuse in a management control system for food safety. As expected, lag phase and growth rate proved to be heavily affected by temperature whereas the inoculum size did not. The Ea values involved in the duration of latent periods, calculated on the basis of the Arrhenius model, were comparable for A. hydrophila and L. monocytogenes strains (from 21.3 to 24.4 kcal/mol), while significantly differed for Y. enterocolitica (16.6 kcal/mol). The Ea values of growth rates were similar for A. hydrophila and L. monocytogenes strains (from 20.9 to 21.1 kcal/mol), while were considerably lower for Y. enterocolitica (from 14.2 to 16.7 kcal/mol). The use of {MKT} is widespread and well-accepted in pharmaceutical field as convenient method for estimating drugs degradation in relation to storage temperature. The Ea value of the lag phase found for L. monocytogenes (23.9 ± 1.2 kcal/mol) was included in the {MKT} formula. In this work, the air temperature of two chilling rooms was monitored during the normal operating activity in a catering company for a period of 8 months. The {MKT} profiles were then compared with those of mean temperatures in different conditions (short or prolonged events of thermal abuse) with the purpose to evaluate if it may be applicable to reduce false alarms without lowering the safety level of stored food.},

	abstract = {Most of the models of microbial growth in food are Empirical algebraic, of which the Gompertz model is the most notable, Rate equations, mostly variants of the Verhulst's logistic model, or Population Dynamics models, which can be deterministic and continuous or stochastic and discrete. The models of the first two kinds only address net growth and hence cannot account for cell mortality that can occur at any phase of the growth. Almost invariably, several alternative models of all three types can describe the same set of experimental growth data. This lack of uniqueness is by itself a reason to question any mechanistic interpretation of growth parameters obtained by curve fitting alone. As argued, all the variants of the Verhulst's model, including the Baranyi-Roberts model, are empirical phenomenological models in a rate equation form. None provides any mechanistic insight or has inherent advantage over the others. In principle, models of all three kinds can predict non-isothermal growth patterns from isothermal data. Thus a modeler should choose the simplest and most convenient model for this purpose. There is no reason to assume that the dependence of the “maximum specific growth rate” on temperature, {pH}, water activity, or other factors follows the original or modified versions of the Arrhenius model, as the success of Ratkowsky's square root model testifies. Most sigmoid isothermal growth curves require three adjustable parameters for their mathematical description and growth curves showing a peak at least four. Although frequently observed, there is no theoretical reason that these growth parameters should always rise and fall in unison in response to changes in external conditions. Thus quantifying the effect of an environmental factor on microbial growth require that all the growth parameters are addressed, not just the “maximum specific growth rate.” Different methods to determine the “lag time” often yield different values, demonstrating that it is a poorly defined growth parameter. The combined effect of several factors, such as temperature and {pH} or aw, need not be “multiplicative” and therefore ought to be revealed experimentally. This might not be always feasible, but keeping the notion in mind will eliminate theoretical assumptions that are hard to confirm. Modern mathematical software allows to model growing or dying microbial populations where cell division and mortality occur simultaneously and can be used to explain how different growth patterns emerge. But at least in the near future, practical problems, like translating a varying temperature into a corresponding microbial growth curve, will be solved with empirical rate models, which despite not being “mechanistic” are perfectly suitable for this purpose.},

Consequently, as originally pointed out by Monod (1949), handling microbial cultures is a fundamental methodology of microbiology and mastering different cultivation techniques should be part of every microbiologist’s craftsmanship. This is particularly important for research in microbial physiology, as the composition and behavior of microbes is strongly dependent on their growth environment. It has been pointed out repeatedly by eminent microbiologists that we should give more attention to the media and culturing conditions. However, this is obviously not adhered to with sufficient rigor as mistakes in basic cultivation principles are frequently found in the published research literature. The most frequent mistakes are the use of inappropriate growth media and little or no control of the specific growth rate, and some examples will be discussed here in detail. Therefore, this is a call for better microbiological craftsmanship when cultivating microbial cultures for physiological experiments. This call is not only addressed to researchers but it is probably even more important for the teaching of our discipline.},
