# **CMEE Coursework Repository**

## **Brief Description**
1. Ideally, a quantitative biologist should be multilingual, knowing:

A modern, easy-to-write, interpreted (or semi-compiled) language that is “reasonably” fast, like `Python`

Mathematical/statistical software with programming and graphing capabilities, like `R`

A compiled (or semi-compiled) ‘procedural’ language, like `C`

2. These works are based on the Notebook and Data from https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio.git.

3. As the course going on, i will add more to the repository
